# Networking Documentation 

For our big team of eight, we split up the team into smaller groups, each group responsible for a different component of the multiplayer game. The networking team is/was responsible for running the server locally and being able to create a multiplayer game. Below is the documentation for how we did what we did (what packages we installed, errors we ran into, etc.):


First, we began by installing npm, a JavaScript package manager, as a part of getting our node.js server to run locally. Below is the command that we used to first install npm:


```
npm install -g npm

```
