# Octo Games: Red Light Green Light
Our latest game is a take on the classic Red Light Green Light. The game is simple, but the fun is endless. The game is played by one person being the "stop light" and the rest of the players being the "cars". The stop light will turn green and the players will move towards the stop light. The stop light will then turn red and the players will stop. If the stop light (when red) catches a player moving, that player is out. The game continues until all cars are out or a car reaches the stop light. The first car to reach the stop light wins.

# Tips on using Phaser3:
Phaser3 is a JavaScript framework for creating games. You can find more information about Phaser3 here. Phaser3 is a very powerful framework, but it can be a little confusing to use at first. Here are some tips to help you get started:

#Phaser3 uses a scene system. Each scene is a different state of the game. For example, the main menu is a scene and the game is a scene. You can find more information about scenes here.

Each scene has a preload(), create(), and update() function. The preload() function is used to load assets. The create() function is used to create objects. The update() function is used to update the game state.

assets: You can find assets for your game here. You can also find assets here. You can also find assets here.
